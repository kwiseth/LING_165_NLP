### Word sense disambiguation

Use the naive Bayes ("bag-of-words") model to classify the use of the word 'drug' in various sentence as meaning 'medical' (1) or 'illegal' (0).
Naive Bayes [todo add brief definition]

**0** = illegal

**1** = medical

The bag-of-words model relies on a simplifying assumption--it disregards word order when counting frequencies.
