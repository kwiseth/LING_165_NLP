Using the provided training data and test data, write Python scripts to estimate expected frequencies based on observed frequencies in the training data using three different approaches:
1. Maximum likelihood estimate
2. Add-one smoothing
3. Good-Turning smoothing

Compare the results of the three different approaches. Output the results in a tabular list.
