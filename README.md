# Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects (Linguistics)
Updating lab assignments from legacy computational linguistics coursework. The entire field of ML and AI has changed since I undertook the [MA in Linguistics](https://www.sjsu.edu/linguistics/programs/linguistics/ma/index.php) at SJSU (2010-2013). Neural networks, transformations, and other deep learning techniques that have given us AI (artificial intelligence) and large language models (LLMs) have become the state of the art. Nonetheless, I want to remind myself of the machine learning basics that I studied at SJSU because it was the best time in my life, and I love to keep learning.
